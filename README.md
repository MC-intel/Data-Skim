1. Install requirements.txt file
"pip -r requirements.txt"

2. Run- RUNTHIS.py
"python RUNTHIS.py"

Quick Start (or colab start):
Now that you've installed the requirement file, or API key in the .zip folder. 
You'll be prompted with a starting section and ending section, where you will be given a space for input.
You will be using these inputs to select the range of data you want to skim from the Example Sheet.
After you select your range, you will be promted to name the file the altered data will be stored in.
Once these 3 inputs are done, an example of the altered data will be shown in the program, and a .csv file will be downloaded into the folder.
The .csv file you named provides access to the data which can then be converted to a format of your choosing.
The function of this program is to fish specific data from a large database.
